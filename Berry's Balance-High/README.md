## How to change resolution
1. Open DeviceProfiles.ini
2. Change this parameter as you want:
```
CVars=r.SecondaryScreenPercentage.GameViewport=83

; numbers in percentage
; 100 = 100% = Native resolution (for example 1080p)
; 200 = 200% = Twice as native resolution (for example 1080*2 is 2160p, basically 4K)
; 75 = 75% = 75% from your native resolution (for example 75% of 1080 is 810p)
```
